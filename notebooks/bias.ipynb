    "# Understanding Bias in Estimators\n",

    "Bias in statistics measures the difference between an estimator's expected value and the true parameter value it aims to estimate. It's a key concept for assessing the accuracy of statistical methods. In this post, we'll explore the concept of bias, provide examples of biased and unbiased estimators, and use Python to illustrate these ideas through simulations.\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias of an estimator is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's go on to give some examples of the bias of an estimator.\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Sample Mean as an Estimator of Population Mean\n",
    "Consider the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ as an estimator of the population mean $\\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimator:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_m = \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias:**\n",
    "Since the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean, we have:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{bias}(\\bar{X}) = E(\\bar{X}) - \\mu = \\mu - \\mu = 0\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Example 2: Sample Variance as an Estimator of Population Variance\n",
    "Consider the sample variance $S^2$ as an estimator of the population variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimator:**\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Bias:**\n",
    "The sample variance is a biased estimator of the population variance. The bias can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{bias}(S^2) = E(S^2) - \\sigma^2 = \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n} \\sigma^2 \\right) - \\sigma^2 = -\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Estimating Population Proportion\n",
    "Consider the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ as an estimator of the population proportion $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimator:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_m = \\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n}\n",

    "**Estimator:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_m = \\tilde{X}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Bias:**\n",
    "The bias of the sample median depends on the underlying distribution. For a symmetric distribution, the sample median is an unbiased estimator:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{bias}(\\tilde{X}) = E(\\tilde{X}) - \\eta = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
